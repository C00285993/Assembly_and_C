This is a converter tool designed to translate assembly code written for the 68000 architecture into equivalent code for x86_64 architecture. The purpose of this converter is to take input from the user in the form of numbers, perform addition operations on these numbers, and then output the resulting sum. The conversion process ensures that the functionality of the original 68000 assembly code is preserved while adapting it to run on x86_64 systems.
